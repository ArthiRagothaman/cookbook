Hey there, i thought we could use the readme to explain what we did. what worked and what didnt.

Fabian:

- I set up a very basic structure for recipe.html and added some CSS in the Html but commented it out.
  If u comment it in you can better visualize which elements are in on div. - Tried to change the icon in the bullte points list to a cooking realated one, but had trouble resizing the image with gimp without loosing to much quality
- did not bother with felxboox since bootstrap will make it on magic i guess
- If any angel thinks that something is missing, should be added or changed i will be happy todo so
